# Vigenère Cipher GUI

This is a Python application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting text using the Vigenère cipher.

## Overview

The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. The Vigenère cipher uses a keyword to shift letters of the plaintext according to a repeating sequence of shifts.

This GUI application allows users to input a text message and a key, and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the message using the Vigenère cipher. The result is displayed in the GUI.

## Features

- **Text Entry**: Users can input the text message they want to encrypt or decrypt.
- **Key Entry**: Users can input the key used for encryption or decryption.
- **Mode Selection**: Users can choose between encryption and decryption modes.
- **Process Button**: Initiates the encryption or decryption process based on the entered text, key, and mode.
- **Result Display**: Displays the encrypted or decrypted text in the GUI.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the text message you want to encrypt or decrypt in the "Text" entry field.
3. Enter the key used for encryption or decryption in the "Key" entry field.
4. Select the mode (Encrypt or Decrypt) by clicking the corresponding radio button.
5. Click the "Process" button to perform the encryption or decryption.
6. The result will be displayed in the "Result" text area.
